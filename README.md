# About DotA2 by the authors
 Every day, millions of players worldwide enter the battle as one of over a hundred Dota Heroes in a 5v5 team clash. 
 Dota is the deepest multi-player action RTS game ever made and there's always a new strategy or tactic to discover. 
 It's completely free to play and always will be. <br>

# DotA2 and Data Analytics
Since DotA2 has a very advanced in-game data collection mechanism, and this data is also served to the community, I wanted to create a data project to practice data software engineering. <br>
The data is collected via opendota API: https://docs.opendota.com/

# Supporting links
- JIRA board: https://pytian.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DOT/boards/2/backlog

# Goal of the project
- Ingest data from the API
- Transform the data and prepare it for analysis
- Analyze data from multiple perspective
- But mainly to practice data engineering skills so I can understand engineers better, and so become a better scrum master / BA / Team Lead

# Tools used for the project
- python 3.11
- sqlite3
- github
- jira
- vscode
